## Overview of Analysis

Creating a bike trip analysis to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We will uses Pandas to change the "tripduration "column from an integer to a datetime datatype. We will create the following visualizations:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

With these new visualizaions we can make a story to pitch to the investors.
